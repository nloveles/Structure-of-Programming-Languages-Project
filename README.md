# Structure-of-Programming-Languages-Project
Nathan Loveless

For my project, I decided to show the difference between functional programming and Procedural Programming. For my two languges I decided to use
C++ and python due to familiarity and feeling they were great examples. Both test if a entered string are palandromes. In my C++ code, it uses the functional 
programing methodolgy. This is done by doing all the of the work via different functions and passing the info back and forth. In my python script, it is demonstration 
procedural methodolgy. This is becasue it does all the work step by step. I complied and ran the c++ code inside of visual studio and for the python script I used python 3.7.
